# Statistics with Python: Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python

My personal notes taken while following the Coursera Specialization ["Statistics with Python"](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics-with-python), from the University of Michingan, hosted by Prof. Dr. Brenda Gunderson.

The Specialization is divided in three courses and each of one has a subfolder with the course notes.

1. [Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-visualization-data?specialization=statistics-with-python): `01_Visualization` 
2. [Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistical-analysis-python?specialization=statistics-with-python): `02_Inference`
3. [Fitting Statistical Models to Data with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/fitting-statistical-models-data-python?specialization=statistics-with-python): `03_Fitting_Models`

The present file is a guide or compilation of notes of the first course: **Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python**.

Overview:
1. What is Statistics?

## 1. What is Statistics?

Statistics is a set of methods that can be applied to learn insights from data.

A "statistic" is a numerical of graphical summary of the data: average, percentage, minimum, etc.

The field of statistics is evolving and new toold are appearing able to tackle problems impossible until recently; for instance: Big Data.

Note that data can be missleading; statistics has tools to avoid missunderstandings and inform for a better decision-making. For instance: data summarization for better uderstanding. Note that we often talk about central values (e.g., averages) when we summarize, but the variation is as important as the central value.

The different perspectives of statistics:
- summarizing
- science ofuncertainty
- science of decisions
- science of variation
- art of forecasting
- science of measurement
- basis for principled data collection

Probability pre-dates statistics: it deals with probability distributions, randomness and uncertainty.
Data science uses statistics, but introduces new technical disciplines, such as databases, machine learning techniques, etc.

## 2. What is Data?

Data can be represneted in numbers, images, words, audio.
