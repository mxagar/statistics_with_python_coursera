# Statistics with Python: Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python

My personal notes taken while following the Coursera Specialization ["Statistics with Python"](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics-with-python), from the University of Michingan, hosted by Prof. Dr. Brenda Gunderson and colleagues.

The Specialization is divided in three courses and each one has a subfolder with the course notes.

1. [Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-visualization-data?specialization=statistics-with-python): `01_Visualization` 
2. [Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistical-analysis-python?specialization=statistics-with-python): `02_Inference`
3. [Fitting Statistical Models to Data with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/fitting-statistical-models-data-python?specialization=statistics-with-python): `03_Fitting_Models`

The present file is a guide or compilation of notes of the second course: **Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python**.
