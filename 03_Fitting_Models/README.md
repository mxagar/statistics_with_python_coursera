# Statistics with Python: Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python

My personal notes taken while following the Coursera Specialization ["Statistics with Python"](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics-with-python), from the University of Michingan, hosted by Dr. Brenda Gunderson.

The Specialization is divided in three courses and each of one has a subfolder with the course notes.
The present folder/section is related to the third course.

1. [Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-visualization-data?specialization=statistics-with-python): `01_Visualization` 
3. [Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistical-analysis-python?specialization=statistics-with-python): `02_Inference`
4. [Fitting Statistical Models to Data with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/fitting-statistical-models-data-python?specialization=statistics-with-python): `03_Fitting_Models`

The **guide/notes of the course: [`Statistics_Python_3_FittingModels.md`](Statistics_Python_3_FittingModels.md)**.

Overview of contents:

- `Statistics_Python_3_FittingModels.md`: guide, notes.
- `lab/`
  - `lab/*.ipynb`: 6 notebooks generated in chronological order during the course covering the learned concepts; see `Statistics_Python_3_FittingModels.md` for more information on them.
  - Datasets used in the notebooks:
    - `Cartwheel.csv`
    - `nap_no_nap.csv`, `S1_Dataset.xlsx`
    - `nhanes_2015_2016.csv`
  - `Akacem_ToddlersNapping_2015.pdf`: paperrelated to the datasets `nap_no_nap.csv` & `S1_Dataset.xlsx`.
