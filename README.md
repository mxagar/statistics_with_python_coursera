# Statistics with Python - Coursera / University of Michigan

These are my personal notes taken while following the Coursera Specialization ["Statistics with Python"](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics-with-python), from the University of Michingan, hosted by Dr. Brenda Gunderson.

The Specialization is divided in three courses and each of one has a subfolder with the course notes:

1. [Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-visualization-data?specialization=statistics-with-python): `01_Visualization` 
3. [Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistical-analysis-python?specialization=statistics-with-python): `02_Inference`
4. [Fitting Statistical Models to Data with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/fitting-statistical-models-data-python?specialization=statistics-with-python): `03_Fitting_Models`

The folder `utils` contains some cheatsheets from [Datacamp](), not pushed to the repository, by accessible from here:
- [Cheatsheet for Numpy](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/python-numpy-cheat-sheet#gs.AK5ZBgE)
- [Cheatsheet for Datawrangling](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/pandas-cheat-sheet-python#gs.HPFoRIc)
- [Cheatsheet for Pandas](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/python-pandas-cheat-sheet#gs.oundfxM)
- [Cheatsheet for SciPy](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/python-scipy-cheat-sheet#gs.JDSg3OI)
- [Cheatsheet for Matplotlib](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/python-matplotlib-cheat-sheet#gs.uEKySpY)

In my case, the Coursera Specialization did not bring so much; I learned how to apply some statistical data analysis with pandas and python, since I had more experience with R, regarding statistics. **As far as the theory is concerned, I think that my notes contained in the following file are much more useful**:

#### TODOs

- [x] Move my old notes on statistics to here.
- [ ] Add a summary notebook on statistics based on these two Medium articles
  - [Statistics 1](https://medium.com/@jonathan-hui/statistics-i-in-data-science-machine-learning-40444379dd43)
  - [Statistics 2](https://jonathan-hui.medium.com/statistics-ii-in-data-science-machine-learning-d3daad84dae4)
