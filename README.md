# Statistics with Python - Coursera / University of Michigan

My personal notes taken while following the Coursera Specialization ["Statistics with Python"](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics-with-python), from the University of Michingan, hosted by Dr. Brenda Gunderson.

The Specialization is divided in three courses and each of one has a subfolder with the course notes:

1. [Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-visualization-data?specialization=statistics-with-python): `01_Visualization` 
3. [Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/inferential-statistical-analysis-python?specialization=statistics-with-python): `02_Inference`
4. [Fitting Statistical Models to Data with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/fitting-statistical-models-data-python?specialization=statistics-with-python): `03_Fitting_Models`

The folder `utils` contains some cheatsheets from [Datacamp](), not pushed to the repository, by accessible from here:
- [Cheatsheet for Numpy](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/python-numpy-cheat-sheet#gs.AK5ZBgE)
